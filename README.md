# AttendlyApplication
Attendly is an IOS Application 

Attendly Students and lecturers struggle daily when it comes to keeping up with class attendance. It takes up much of the class time which could be put to much better use! In addition, students are constantly in doubt of their absencesâ€™ percentage.

Attendly aims to solve this issue by allowing students to easily mark their own attendance, have easy access to all their absences through a dashboard, and get notified about their absences when needed.
